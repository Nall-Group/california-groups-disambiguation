Open `2_webapp/app.R`\n2. Click the \"Run App\" button in RStudio\n\n#### From Command Line:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to the 2_webapp directory\ncd 2_webapp\nR -e \"shiny::runApp()\"\n```\n\nThe app will start a local server (typically at `http://127.0.0.1:XXXX`) and automatically open in your browser.\n\n## App Features\n\n- **Clean, responsive interface** with professional styling\n- **Direct link** to the California Groups spreadsheet on GitHub\n- **Opens in new tab** - GitHub link opens in a separate browser tab\n- **Mobile-friendly** design with hover effects\n\n## App Structure\n\n- `app.R` - Main Shiny application file containing UI and server logic\n- Uses **tidyverse** and **shiny** packages\n- Minimal server logic (static page with styled HTML link)\n\n## Customization\n\nThe app uses custom CSS styling defined in the UI. Key style elements:\n\n- Bootstrap-style container layout\n- Blue button styling with hover effects\n- Centered layout with shadow effects\n- Responsive design\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues:\n\n1. **Package not found**: Make sure you've run the setup script from the project root\n2. **Port already in use**: Shiny will automatically find an available port\n3. **renv not activated**: Make sure you're running R from the project root directory\n\n### Adding New Dependencies:\n\nIf you need to add new R packages:\n\n1. Install the package: `install.packages(\"package_name\")`\n2. Update the lock file: `renv::snapshot()`\n3. The package will be available for all users who run `renv::restore()`\n\n## Links\n\n- [California Groups
