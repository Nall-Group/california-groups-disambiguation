# Claude Notes

## Goal

We are building and cleaning a map of organization names so we can "crosswalk" how different organization names relate to each other. For each organization there is a canonical name, and other organization names may be alternate spellings or chapters of an organization. Basically, it's a forest of tree structures. The trees can be nested to any depth (e.g. you can have an alternate spelling of a chapter)

Note that you shouldn't remove entries unless they are exact duplicates since we need to be able to categorize all organizations that appear in the dataset, even if they are spelled wrong.

## Crosswalk Data

- `crosswalk.standardizenames.manualedits_clean.csv` - original source, DO NOT EDIT
- `2_webapp/org_clusters_crosswalk.json` - live file, all updates go here
- For the CSV file some of the items in the file contain commas and you need to parse it properly. Don't just parse it by comma use CSV parsing libraries
